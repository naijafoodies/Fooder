                 <code>Naija Foodies reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to you,
                  to change these Terms of Use in our sole and absolute discretion.
                  The most current version of the Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions.

                  <p><strong>Payments and Refunds.</strong></p>
                  <code>If an order is to be delivered, payments must be made in full prior to the food being delivered.
                    Absolutely no payments are to be made to the delivery agent.
                    If an order is to be picked up, the customer would have an option of paying by credit or debit card,
                    or paying with the exact amount of the order – as change won’t be issued for onsite pickups.
                    For catering orders, payments must be made in full prior to the food being delivered. A minimum of 50% of the total
                     food cost will be paid at the point of agreement, a contract will be signed obligating the customer to pay the balance before the order
                      is delivered, and the owner is challenged to deliver results as well.
                    All payments are final. NO REFUNDS WILL BE ISSUED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHATSOEVER.</code><br/><br/>
