    <p class="bodyOne" style="display:none;">Naija Foodies, LLC was created in 2017, and is the first ever online African restaurant in Indiana.
      It was created to give our customers an authentic African culinary experience delivered right to the
       convenience of their homes.</p>

    <p class="bodyTwo" style="display:none;">Naijafoodies.com was created in response to a need for a restaurant which would offer a
      variety of African delicacies at an affordable price while being within the reach of interested consumers.
       We have responded adequately to that need and will continue to improve our processes to ensure your complete
       satisfaction every time you order from us. </p>
